        <p class="text">
          An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is
          typically bold, sometimes risky. Adventures may be activities with
          danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing,
          scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports.
          <br /><br />
          Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in
          order to achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that
          can only be obtained by such activities.

          cycling, use of a bicycle for sport, recreation, or transportation.
          The sport of cycling consists of professional and amateur races, which
          are held mostly in continental Europe, the United States, and Asia.
          <br /><br />
          The recreational use of the bicycle is widespread in Europe and the
          United States. Use of the bicycle as a mode of transportation is
          particularly important in non-Western nations and in flatter
          countries, some of which, like the Netherlands, have a widespread
          system of bicycle paths.

          <h2 class="desc">PARA GLINDING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of
          flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider
          aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a
          harness or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing
          shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air
          entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of
          the air flowing over the outside.
          <br /><br />
          Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours
          and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five
          hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By
          skillful exploitation of sources of  lift, the pilot may gain height,
          often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

          <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or
          two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section,
          or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer
          towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on
          ocean shores, but can also be found as standing waves in the open
          ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or wave pools.
          <br /><br />
          The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board,
          regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche
          of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of
          the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft.
          Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the
          modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding
          a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up
          surfing. Another prominent form of surfing is body boarding, where a
          surfer rides the wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly,
          drop knee (one foot and one knee on the board), or sometimes even
          standing up on a body board. Other types of surfing include knee
          boarding, surf matting (riding inflatable mats) and using foils. Body
          surfing, in which the wave is caught and ridden using the surfer's own
          body rather than a board, is very common and is considered by some
          surfers to be the purest form of surfing
